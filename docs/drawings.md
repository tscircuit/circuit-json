# Drawing page and part-view configuration

`drawing_page` configures paper layout for `<assembly.drawing.page>`.
`drawing_part_view` configures a view of selected assembly geometry for
`<assembly.drawing.partview>`. There is no generated asset element or image URL:
Circuit JSON describes what to draw, and exporters decide how to render it.

A page has `drawing_page_id`, optional name/display_name and positive width/height
in mm. A part view has `drawing_part_view_id`, a `drawing_page_id` reference,
center/width/height in paper mm, direction, optional scale, hidden-edge visibility
and a section plane. Each part view may select `source_group_id` (including its
descendants) and/or narrow the selection to `source_component_ids`. Without either
selector the enclosing assembly's geometry is used. Core resolves TSX target
selectors to these source IDs; renderers do not resolve TSX selectors or GLB names.
Different part views on the same page can show different geometry.

CAD coordinates use mm, +Z up. Paper origin is page center, +X right/+Y up.
Directions use snake_case: x_positive/x_negative/y_positive/y_negative/
z_positive/z_negative/isometric. The named axis side is where the camera sits,
looking toward the selected geometry's center. X/Y views use +Z paper up; Z views
use +Y paper up. Isometric observes from positive X/Y/Z. TSX signed axis literals
map to these canonical values, e.g. z+ becomes z_positive.

Scale is model-to-paper: 0.5 means 1:2. Omit to fit with a margin. Explicit scale
clips excess geometry to the viewport. Hidden edges default to omitted; enabling
them uses dashed strokes. There is no style enum or authored image/resource field.

Sections use CAD world mm: axis, finite offset and explicit keep_side. less keeps
coordinates <= offset; greater keeps >= offset. hatch_spacing defaults to 1mm,
measured perpendicular to 45-degree hatch strokes. Cavities remain empty and open
contours remain uncapped. Renderers must transform offsets and retained sides
along with axes at coordinate boundaries (CAD to glTF: x,y,z -> x,z,-y).

IDs must be unique and part-view page references must resolve; consumers enforce
these document-level constraints. All numbers are finite. These new records have
no aliases or migration requirements. They intentionally describe configuration
only; rendered files belong to exporter output, not Circuit JSON.

## Standard references

Named sheet sizes use `iso_a0`–`iso_a4` and `ansi_a`–`ansi_e`, with `landscape` (default) or `portrait` orientation. Custom pages retain explicit width and height. Dimensions are always mm; ANSI inch dimensions are converted exactly using 25.4 mm/in (ANSI A is 279.4 × 215.9 mm in landscape).

- [ISO 5457:1999](https://www.iso.org/standard/29017.html): drawing-sheet sizes and layout.
- [ASME Y14.1](https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/drawing-sheet-size-and-format): metric and decimal-inch drawing sheets.
- [Autodesk Fusion sheet-size reference](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/Fusion-Drawing/files/DWG-REF-SHEET-SIZE.htm): interoperable ISO A0–A4 and ANSI A–E dimensions.
- [ISO 7200:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/35446.html): title-block and document-header data fields.

These references guide sizes and metadata terminology. This proposal does not claim complete ISO/ASME template compliance or prescribe a projection method. Sheet orientation does not rotate model views.

A `drawing_page` retains resolved numeric `width`/`height` and optional `page_size`/`orientation`; supplied dimensions must match the named size. `getDrawingPageDimensions("iso_a4", "landscape")` returns `{width: 297, height: 210}`. Omitting page_size preserves custom-page compatibility; orientation without page_size is rejected.

A separate optional `drawing_page_title_block` references `drawing_page_id` and has its own `drawing_page_title_block_id`. It requires `title`; optional fields are `legal_owner`, `identification_number`, `revision_index`, `date_of_issue`, `creator`, `approval_person`, `sheet_number`, and `number_of_sheets`. No images or generated assets are stored in it. Dates are caller-authored strings. Sheet numbers/counts are positive integers; a supplied number cannot exceed its total.
